* Getting started with Amplify for automated Frontend deployment
* Getting started with AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for backend deployment
* Automating Backend deployment with Code Build
* Gitlab to CodeCommit for automation in AWS

Technology Stack:
In those tutorials I will focus on infrastructure and automated deployment. How to build front and back end is up to you. For the frontend I will use Vanilla JS not to be framework specific and Bootstrap to save time.
For the backend I will use Python, mostly because I feel  comfortable with this language. I also find writing lambda function in NodeJs to be a pain, I tend to spend more time dealing with async issues rather than writing business logic.
Those are my personal preferences and I don't aim to convince you one way or another. You can follow those tutorials using React, Vue or anything else. You can also very easily adapt all the APIs in NodeJS, Go or which language you see fit.
